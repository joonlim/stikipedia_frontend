Stikipedia

How to set up Stikipedia on Linux
---------------------------------

If you have apache2, clone the repo into /var/www/html. The directory will be called /stikipedia. If not, clone elsewhere, install apache2, then move to /stiki to /var/www/html. This is the only way we can view our site. 

After cloning, check to see if it worked by typing localhost/stikipedia/edit_page.html in a browser.

1.  Check if Apache2 is installed on server. To check type 'localhost' into a browser's url and see if it works.

    If not, type:

    	sudo apt-get update
    	sudo apt-get install apache2

    Now check to see if it works by typing 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' into a browser and checking if it takes you to a page that says "it works!".

    apache2 commands(you may want to create aliases):

    	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start   :  start server
    	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop    :  stop server
    	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart :  restart server

    Now the /var/www/html directory should exist. This directory is in the root and you can only access files with the sudo command.

    You may need to give the files permission for Bootstrap to work properly.

    If Bootstrap is not working, go to /var/www/html/stikipedia/ in the terminal and run the command:

    	find . -type d -exec chmod +rx {} \;

    This command recursively gives all folders/files permissions, which allows bootstrap files to be read. The reason this must be done is because the /var folder is in the root.

2.  Now make sure php is installed by typing in terminal:

    	php -r "Print \"Hello, World!\";"

    If the output is not correct, you must install php with the command:

    	sudo apt-get update #if you didnt before
    	sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5

    Now type to restart the server:

    	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

    Congratulations! You can now add .php files to the /var/www/html/ folder and open them in an enabled browser by typing 'localhost/file.php'. 

    Basically replace '/var/www/html' with 'localhost' to view php content in the browser..

Now that we have everything set up, clone the repo if you did not before or move the repo into the /var/www/html/folder. The site should work! Again, check with:
	
	localhost/stikipedia/

3. Now we have to set up our configuration to allow support for the API/.htaccess file. The purpose of this file is to redirect any URL patterned "/API/Title" to /API/?title=Title".

    First, configure Apache mod_rewrite

        sudo a2enmod rewrite

    Open file as

        sudo vim /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

    Now find the line where there is 

        <Directory /var/www/>
                 Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
                 AllowOverride None
                 Require all granted
        </Directory>

    and replace "None" with All" to make it look like

        AllowOverride All

    Don't forget to restart apache.

        /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

4. The last thing we need to install for our project to work is MySQL and PhpMyAdmin.
    
    Type the command:

        sudo apt-get install mysql-server

    If you don't choose a password it defaults to "root".

    Once that finishes type:

        sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql phpmyadmin

    The web server that should be automatically configured to run phpMyAdmin is 'apache2'.

    Select <Yes> for the next step. Now choose a password for phpMyAdmin(empty means password is set to 'root' again).

    Now we should set a link to /phpmyadmin from the apache server:

        sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/phpmyadmin

    Check to see that it worked by going to 'localhost/phpmyadmin' in a browser.

    Restart again.

        /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
